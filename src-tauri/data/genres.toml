# sAIpling Genre Classification
# ============================================================================
# This file defines all supported genres and sub-genres for book projects.
# It is loaded by the Rust backend and serves as the data source for the
# genre selection UI (two-panel layout) and AI context (word count targets,
# genre-aware prompting).
#
# Structure:
#   [meta]                     - File version for future migration support
#   [[genres]]                 - Array of genre entries (order = display order)
#     id                       - Unique snake_case identifier (stored in project.json)
#     name                     - Display name shown in the UI
#     sort_order               - Explicit ordering for the genre list
#     description              - Short paragraph shown in the info panel
#     novel_word_count_min/max - Recommended total word count range
#     chapter_word_count_min/max - Recommended per-chapter word count range
#     [[genres.sub_genres]]    - Array of sub-genre entries for this genre
#       id                     - Unique snake_case identifier (scoped to parent)
#       name                   - Display name
#       description            - Short description shown when sub-genre selected
#
# Adding a new genre or sub-genre:
#   1. Append a new [[genres]] or [[genres.sub_genres]] block
#   2. Assign a unique `id` (snake_case, no spaces)
#   3. The UI and Rust structs pick it up automatically — no code changes needed
