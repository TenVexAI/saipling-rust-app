# Beat 16: Darkest Moment — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Darkest Moment is the story's emotional nadir. The
protagonist has lost — or believes they've lost — everything that matters. Their
plan has failed, their allies may be scattered, and the antagonist seems
unstoppable. This is the "all is lost" moment.

**Act**: 3 — The Transformed World

**Questions to consider**:
- What is the worst thing that happens to the protagonist?
- What loss or failure makes this moment feel truly hopeless?
- How does the protagonist's defining flaw contribute to this disaster?
- What does the protagonist do in their lowest moment?
- What buried strength or truth begins to surface in the darkness?

Brainstorm below.
