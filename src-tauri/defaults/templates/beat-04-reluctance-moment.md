# Beat 4: Reluctance Moment — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Reluctance Moment is the protagonist's natural
resistance to change. They've seen the disruption, but they don't want to engage
with it. This beat shows the pull of the familiar — the comfort zone fighting
back against the call to adventure.

**Act**: 1 — The Known World

**Questions to consider**:
- Why does the protagonist resist the call to action?
- What fears or rationalizations hold them back?
- What would they rather do instead?
- What or who pushes them to reconsider?
- How does this reluctance reveal their defining flaw?

Brainstorm below.
