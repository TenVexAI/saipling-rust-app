# Food & Cuisine Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this culinary element. Food is one of the most
visceral ways to make a fictional world feel real — it engages the senses and
reveals culture, class, and geography.

Think about:
- What are the staple foods and signature dishes?
- What ingredients are common, rare, or forbidden?
- How is food prepared and by whom?
- What role does food play in social gatherings, rituals, or celebrations?
- How does food reflect class, wealth, or regional differences?
- Are there food shortages, trade routes, or conflicts over resources?
- What does food reveal about your world's climate and geography?
- How can food scenes deepen character or advance plot?
