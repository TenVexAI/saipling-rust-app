# Central Conflict — Brainstorm

The **Central Conflict** is the primary opposition to the protagonist's desires.
This is the engine that drives the entire plot. Without conflict, there is no
story.

Think about:
- What is the main obstacle standing between the protagonist and their goal?
- Is the conflict external (antagonist, society, nature) or internal (fear, flaw, belief)?
- What makes this conflict impossible to simply walk away from?
- How does the conflict escalate over the course of the story?
- How does the conflict test the protagonist's defining flaw?
- What are the stakes — what happens if the protagonist fails?
- How does resolving this conflict require the protagonist to change?

The strongest stories interweave external and internal conflict — the outer battle
mirrors the inner one.

Brainstorm your central conflict below.
