# Beat 2: Daily Life — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: Daily Life expands the Opening Image into a fuller picture
of the protagonist's routine world. We see their relationships, their work, their
habits — everything that constitutes "normal" before the story disrupts it.

**Act**: 1 — The Known World

**Questions to consider**:
- What does a typical day look like for the protagonist?
- Who are the important people in their daily life?
- What routines, habits, or coping mechanisms define them?
- What small frustrations or desires hint at deeper dissatisfaction?
- What do they take for granted that they'll later lose or revalue?

Brainstorm below.
