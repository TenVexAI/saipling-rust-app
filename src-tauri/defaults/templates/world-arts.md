# Arts & Entertainment Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this artistic or entertainment element. What a
culture creates for pleasure and expression reveals its deepest values, fears,
and aspirations.

Think about:
- What form does it take? (music, visual art, theater, literature, sport)
- Who creates it? Who consumes it?
- What themes or subjects dominate?
- Is it controlled, censored, or used as propaganda?
- What role does it play in social life?
- How does it reflect or challenge the status quo?
- Are there famous works, performers, or venues?
- How does it connect to your story or characters?
