# Language Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this language or communication system. Language
shapes thought — how characters speak reveals who they are, where they come
from, and what they value.

Think about:
- What does it sound like? What makes it distinctive?
- Who speaks it? Is it widespread or dying out?
- Are there dialects, slang, or registers that mark social class?
- What can be expressed in this language that can't in others?
- How does it create barriers or connections between characters?
- Are there forbidden words, sacred phrases, or coded speech?
- How does it relate to power, identity, or belonging?
- What role does it play in your story?
