# Style Guide Notes

These notes will help shape the voice, feel, and personality of your prose. Work through whatever interests you, skip what doesn't, and jot down anything that comes to mind — even rough thoughts are useful. When you're ready, use **Chat** to talk through your ideas and **Generate** to turn these notes into a polished style guide the AI will reference while writing and editing.

**Nothing here is required.** The AI will work with whatever you give it. A single section with a few sentences can be just as effective as a fully detailed guide. Delete any section you don't want to think about right now — you can always regenerate this template or add sections later.

## Comparative Titles & Influences

This is often the most powerful section you can fill out. Naming books or authors whose style you admire communicates an enormous amount in very few words — prose rhythm, vocabulary level, tone, pacing, and sensibility all at once.

- What books feel closest to what you want this novel to read like?
- Are there specific authors whose prose style you admire or want to channel?
- Are there styles you explicitly want to avoid? ("Not like [author/book] because...")
- If you could describe your ideal prose as "[Author A] meets [Author B]," what would that be?

## Voice & Prose Style

Voice is the personality of the writing itself — how the sentences sound in the reader's head. Two thrillers can have completely different voices: one clipped and cold, the other breathless and intimate.

- Should the prose feel **spare and clean** (short sentences, simple words, lots of white space) or **rich and layered** (longer sentences, varied structure, descriptive language)?
- Should the writing style be invisible — staying out of the way so the reader focuses on the story — or distinctive and stylized, where the prose itself is part of the experience?
- How complex should the vocabulary be? Accessible and straightforward, or elevated and literary?
- Should sentences tend toward short and punchy, long and flowing, or a deliberate mix of both?
- Are there any specific voice qualities you want? (dry wit woven into narration, poetic imagery, clinical precision, conversational warmth, raw and unpolished, etc.)

## Tone & Mood

Tone is the emotional atmosphere of the story — what the reader *feels* while reading. A story can shift in tone across its arc, but most novels have a dominant emotional register that holds everything together.

- What is the primary emotional atmosphere? (dark, hopeful, melancholic, suspenseful, whimsical, gritty, warm, eerie, playful, intense, etc.)
- Are there secondary tones that weave in alongside the primary one? (e.g., "primarily suspenseful with threads of dark humor")
- Should the tone stay consistent throughout, or shift deliberately across the story's arc? If it shifts, how? (e.g., "starts lighthearted and grows progressively darker")
- Even in the story's heaviest moments, is there anything that should always be present? (humor, hope, beauty, irony?)

## Pacing & Structure

Pacing is the speed at which the story moves — not just plot speed, but how long the prose lingers in any given moment. A fast-paced novel pushes the reader forward relentlessly. A slow-burn novel invites the reader to settle in.

- Should the overall pace feel **fast and propulsive** (short chapters, constant momentum, minimal lingering) or **slow and immersive** (long chapters, room to breathe, moments of stillness)?
- Should pacing vary by scene type? (e.g., action scenes quick and clipped, emotional scenes slow and detailed)
- How should chapters end — on hooks and cliffhangers that pull the reader forward, or on moments of resolution that let scenes land?
- How should time skips be handled? Stated explicitly ("Three weeks later"), implied through context, or covered with brief summary narration?
- How should scene transitions feel — hard cuts, smooth bridges, or white space breaks that let the reader fill the gap?

## Dialogue

Dialogue is where characters come alive — and every writer has strong instincts about how it should sound on the page, even if they haven't articulated them yet.

- **Dialogue tags:** Do you prefer simple ("said/asked"), varied ("muttered, exclaimed, snapped"), or minimal tags replaced by action beats? ("She set down her glass. 'That's not what happened.'")
- Should dialogue feel **naturalistic** (interruptions, fragments, people talking over each other, trailing off) or **polished** (clean, articulate, every line purposeful)?
- How much **subtext** should dialogue carry? Do characters say what they mean, or do they talk around things — with the real meaning living between the lines?
- Is **banter** a significant part of the dialogue style? If so, what kind? (witty, combative, flirtatious, dry?)
- How should dialect, accent, or speech patterns be handled? Rendered phonetically ("gonna," "y'all"), suggested through word choice and rhythm, or kept clean?
- Should characters have noticeably **distinct voices**, or is a more uniform style acceptable?

## Description & Sensory Detail

This is the camera lens of your story — how much the reader sees, hears, smells, and feels of the world around the characters.

- Should settings be described **minimally** (a few key details, let the reader imagine the rest), **moderately** (enough to ground the scene), or **immersively** (rich, layered descriptions that build atmosphere)?
- Are there particular **senses** you want emphasized? (Visual detail? Sound? Smell and texture? Physical sensation?)
- Should settings be established up front when a scene opens, or revealed gradually through the character's interaction with the space?
- How much environmental detail should be woven into action versus pausing the narrative to describe?
- Are there types of description you want to avoid? (lengthy landscape passages, overly detailed room descriptions, etc.)

## Interiority & Emotion

Interiority is how the reader accesses a character's inner life — their thoughts, feelings, and private reactions. This is closely tied to your chosen perspective, but there's a lot of room for preference within any POV.

- When characters think, how should it appear on the page?
  - **Direct thought** in italics: *I can't believe he said that.*
  - **Free indirect style** blended into narration: She couldn't believe he'd said that. Of all the idiotic, thoughtless—
  - **Minimal interiority** — let actions, dialogue, and body language carry the emotion instead
- Should the narrator ever **name emotions** directly ("she felt angry," "grief washed over him") or always **externalize** them through physical sensation and behavior ("her jaw tightened," "he stared at the wall until the light changed")?
- How much **introspection** should characters engage in? Should emotional scenes include extended internal processing, or should the prose keep moving forward and let the emotion land through what happens next?
- Is there a balance between showing and telling that feels right to you? (Some telling is efficient and effective — "It was the worst year of her life" — while showing dramatizes — depicting that year scene by scene.)

## Content Boundaries

These help ensure the AI writes content that matches your vision and your audience's expectations. For each category, note your comfort level and any specific guidance.

- **Violence & Gore:** How graphic can violent scenes be? (Off-page only / implied aftermath / moderate detail / graphic and unflinching)
- **Sexual Content:** (None / fade-to-black / moderate / explicit)
- **Profanity:** (None / mild-occasional / moderate / heavy-frequent) Any specific words to use or avoid?
- **Dark Themes:** How heavy can the thematic content get? (Light / moderate / heavy — e.g., abuse, addiction, trauma depicted in detail)
- Any other content considerations? (e.g., "no harm to animals," "no child death on-page")

## Exposition & Worldbuilding Delivery

This matters most for stories with significant worldbuilding (fantasy, sci-fi, historical) but applies anywhere the reader needs to learn things the characters already know.

- How should backstory and world information reach the reader?
  - Woven into action and dialogue — never stop the story to explain
  - Brief narrator asides when needed — a sentence or two of context, then back to the scene
  - Character discovery — the reader learns alongside a character who's also new to this world
  - Comfortable with well-crafted expository passages when the world demands it
- How much should the reader be trusted to figure things out on their own versus having things explained?
- Should unfamiliar terms and concepts be defined immediately, contextually, or left for the reader to piece together?

## Narrative Techniques

These are specific storytelling devices you want the AI to use — or avoid. Check, note, or delete as needed.

- **Foreshadowing:** Heavy (reader should sense what's coming), subtle (only visible in retrospect), or minimal?
- **Flashbacks:** Use them freely, use sparingly and clearly marked, or avoid entirely?
- **Symbolism & Motifs:** Should recurring symbols or images be woven through the story? Any specific ones you have in mind?
- **Unreliable narration:** Is the narrator's account trustworthy, or should there be gaps, distortions, or intentional misdirection?
- **Epistolary elements:** Should documents (letters, texts, emails, reports, journal entries) appear within the narrative?
- **Chapter epigraphs:** Quotes, excerpts, or fictional documents at the start of chapters?
- **Multiple timelines:** Does the story move between time periods?
- **Frame narrative:** Is the story being told within another story?

Anything to explicitly **avoid**? (Dream sequences, breaking the fourth wall, deus ex machina, etc.)

## Humor

Skip this section entirely if humor isn't a significant part of your story's voice.

- What kind of humor fits this story? (Dry/deadpan, witty wordplay, dark humor, sarcastic, absurdist, situational, slapstick, irreverent?)
- Where does the humor live — in the narration, in dialogue, in situations, or all three?
- Is humor a constant thread or reserved for specific moments of relief between heavier scenes?
- Any types of humor to avoid? (Nothing too broad, no puns, avoid sarcasm, etc.)

*Your notes:*

## Reading Level & Accessibility

This is especially relevant for YA, middle grade, and children's books — but also useful for any writer thinking about their audience.

- How complex should sentence structure be? (Simple and accessible / moderately varied / complex and literary)
- Should vocabulary assume a well-read adult audience, or stay accessible to a broader readership?
- Can the prose include cultural or literary allusions, or should everything be self-contained?
- Is there a target reading level or age group that should influence word choice and complexity?

## Things to Avoid

Every writer has pet peeves and conscious choices about what they never want to see in their prose. List anything here — the AI will treat these as firm rules.

Examples: *no adverbs in dialogue tags, avoid passive voice, don't start chapters with weather, never use "suddenly," no rhetorical questions in narration, avoid clichéd metaphors, don't describe characters by having them look in a mirror...*
