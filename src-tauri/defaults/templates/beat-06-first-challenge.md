# Beat 6: First Challenge — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The First Challenge is the protagonist's initial test in
unfamiliar territory. They're out of their comfort zone and must deal with the
first real obstacle. This beat often reveals how unprepared they are — and
introduces the skills or allies they'll need.

**Act**: 1 — The Known World

**Questions to consider**:
- What is the first obstacle the protagonist faces after committing?
- How do they attempt to handle it? Do they succeed or fail?
- What does this challenge reveal about their strengths and weaknesses?
- Who helps them, and who stands in their way?
- How does this experience begin to change them?

Brainstorm below.
