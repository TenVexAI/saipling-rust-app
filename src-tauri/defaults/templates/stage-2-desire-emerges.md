# Stage 2: Desire Emerges — Brainstorm
**Character**: {{name}}

**What this stage is**: Desire Emerges is when the character first feels the pull
of something new — a want, a need, or an opportunity that disrupts their comfort
zone. The inciting incident awakens a desire they may not fully understand yet.

**Aligns with beats**: Beat 3 (Inciting Incident), Beat 4 (Reluctance Moment)

**Questions to consider**:
- What does this character begin to want that they didn't want before?
- How does the inciting incident specifically affect them?
- What resistance or reluctance do they feel?
- How does their Defining Flaw shape their initial response?
- What would they lose by pursuing this new desire?

Brainstorm below.
