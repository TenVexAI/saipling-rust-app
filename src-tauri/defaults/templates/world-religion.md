# Religion & Belief System Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this religion or belief system. Faith in fiction
is a powerful force — it motivates characters, justifies actions, and creates
deep conflict when beliefs collide with reality.

Think about:
- What do believers hold as sacred truth?
- What are the core practices, rituals, or observances?
- How is it organized? (clergy, temples, hierarchy, decentralized)
- What is its origin story or founding myth?
- How does it view the supernatural, the afterlife, or morality?
- What tensions exist within the faith? (reformers vs. traditionalists)
- How does it interact with political power?
- How does it create conflict or meaning for your characters?
