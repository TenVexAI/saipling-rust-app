# Calendar & Timekeeping Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about how time is measured and marked in your world.
Calendars and seasons shape the rhythm of life — they determine when people
celebrate, mourn, plant, harvest, and go to war.

Think about:
- How is time measured? (days, months, seasons, ages)
- What calendar system is used? Is it solar, lunar, or something else?
- What are the major festivals, holidays, or observances?
- How do seasons affect daily life and the story?
- Are there sacred or cursed times?
- How does timekeeping differ between cultures or regions?
- What role does the passage of time play in your story?
- Are there deadlines, countdowns, or time-sensitive plot elements?
