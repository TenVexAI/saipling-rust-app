# Theme Statement — Brainstorm

The **Theme Statement** is the fundamental truth the story explores. Theme is what
gives a story meaning beyond its plot. It's the answer to the question "what is
this story really about?"

A strong theme:
- Can be expressed as a statement, not just a topic ("Love conquers fear" vs. just "love")
- Creates tension — characters can argue both sides of it
- Is tested through the protagonist's journey
- Resonates with universal human experience

Example: "True strength comes not from independence, but from the courage to be
vulnerable with those who matter."

Brainstorm your theme ideas below.
