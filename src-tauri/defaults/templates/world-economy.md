# Economy & Trade Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this economic element. Money and resources drive
conflict — who has them, who wants them, and what people will do to get them.

Think about:
- What are the primary resources, goods, or currencies?
- Who controls the wealth? How is it distributed?
- What does trade look like? (routes, partners, smuggling)
- What do people do for work? What are the class divisions?
- What economic pressures affect your characters?
- What scarcity or abundance shapes daily life?
- How does economic power translate to political power?
- What happens when the economy is disrupted?
