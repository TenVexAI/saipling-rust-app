# Beat 20: Transformed Reality — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Transformed Reality shows the new status quo after
the journey. The dust has settled, and we see what the world looks like now —
changed by everything that happened. This beat demonstrates the lasting impact
of the protagonist's choices — what's different, what's healed, and what scars
remain.

**Act**: 3 — The Transformed World

**Questions to consider**:
- What does the protagonist's new daily life look like?
- How are they different from who they were at the beginning?
- What relationships have changed, ended, or begun?
- What new role or purpose do they have?
- How does the transformed reality reflect the theme?

Brainstorm below.
