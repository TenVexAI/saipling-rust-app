# Beat 12: Growing Opposition — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: Growing Opposition marks the beginning of the story's
downward pressure. The antagonist or opposing forces adapt, escalate, and push
back harder. The protagonist's earlier wins start to unravel. The cost of the
journey becomes increasingly clear.

**Act**: 2 — The Unknown World

**Questions to consider**:
- How does the opposition intensify after the midpoint?
- What new threats or complications emerge?
- What does the protagonist lose or sacrifice?
- How do relationships strain under pressure?
- What mistakes does the protagonist make under stress?

Brainstorm below.
