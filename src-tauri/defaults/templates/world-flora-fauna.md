# Flora & Fauna Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this creature, plant, or ecosystem. The natural
world of your story creates atmosphere, danger, wonder, and sometimes the most
memorable moments.

Think about:
- What is it? What does it look like, sound like, behave like?
- Where does it live? What is its natural habitat?
- Is it dangerous, useful, sacred, or mundane?
- How do people in your world interact with it?
- Does it have any special properties or abilities?
- What role does it play in the ecosystem?
- How does it connect to your story's themes or conflicts?
- What would your world be like without it?
