# Technology Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this technology. The best fictional technology
isn't just cool — it changes how people live, creates new problems, and shifts
the balance of power.

Think about:
- What is it and how does it work?
- Who invented or developed it? When?
- Who has access to it? Is it widespread or restricted?
- What are its limitations or costs?
- How has it changed society, warfare, or daily life?
- What new problems or conflicts has it created?
- How do different characters or groups use (or abuse) it?
- What would happen if it failed or was taken away?
