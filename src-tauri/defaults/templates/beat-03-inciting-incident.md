# Beat 3: Inciting Incident — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Inciting Incident is the event that disrupts the
status quo — the thing that makes this day different from every other day. This
is the moment the story truly begins.

**Act**: 1 — The Known World
**Anchor beat**: Yes — this is one of the four structural pillars of your story.

**Questions to consider**:
- What event forces your protagonist out of their routine?
- How does this event connect to the Central Conflict?
- What makes this moment impossible to ignore?
- How does the protagonist initially react?

Brainstorm below.
