# Beat 11: Midpoint Shift — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Midpoint Shift is the turning point of the entire
story. Something fundamental changes — a revelation, a reversal, a raising of
stakes. The protagonist can no longer pursue their goal the same way. The nature
of the conflict transforms.

**Act**: 2 — The Unknown World
**Anchor beat**: Yes — this is one of the four structural pillars of your story.

**Questions to consider**:
- What revelation, event, or reversal changes everything?
- How does this shift redefine the protagonist's understanding of the conflict?
- How do the stakes escalate?
- Does the protagonist shift from reactive to proactive (or vice versa)?
- How does this moment connect to the theme?

Brainstorm below.
