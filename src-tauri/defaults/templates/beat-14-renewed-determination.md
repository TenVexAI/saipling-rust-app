# Beat 14: Renewed Determination — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: Renewed Determination is the protagonist's recovery from
doubt. Something reignites their resolve — a reminder of what's at stake, an
act of loyalty from an ally, or a new piece of information that changes the
equation. They recommit, but with harder-won wisdom.

**Act**: 2 — The Unknown World

**Questions to consider**:
- What sparks the protagonist's renewed resolve?
- How has their approach or understanding changed since the doubt?
- What new plan or strategy do they adopt?
- How do they rally their allies?
- What makes this commitment feel different from the original one?

Brainstorm below.
