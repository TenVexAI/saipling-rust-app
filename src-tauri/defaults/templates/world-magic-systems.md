- What can it do? What are its most common uses?
- What are its rules and limitations?
- What is the cost of using it? (physical, emotional, moral, material)
- Who can use it? Is it innate, learned, or granted?
- How is it viewed by society? (revered, feared, regulated, hidden)
- How does it affect the balance of power in your world?
- What happens when it goes wrong?
