# Beat 13: Moment of Doubt — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Moment of Doubt is where the protagonist questions
everything. Their confidence is shaken, their plan is failing, and they wonder
if the journey was worth it. This is the emotional low point of Act 2 — not yet
the darkest moment, but the seed of despair.

**Act**: 2 — The Unknown World

**Questions to consider**:
- What causes the protagonist to lose faith in their mission?
- What internal doubts surface? How does their flaw amplify the crisis?
- Do they consider giving up, retreating, or changing course?
- How do allies react to the protagonist's wavering?
- What keeps them from quitting entirely?

Brainstorm below.
