# Beat 5: Point of Departure — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Point of Departure is where the protagonist commits
to the journey. Whether by choice or circumstance, they cross a line — and there's
no going back to the way things were. The old world is left behind.

**Act**: 1 — The Known World

**Questions to consider**:
- What finally pushes the protagonist past their reluctance?
- What decision or event makes the commitment irreversible?
- What do they leave behind? (people, places, safety, identity)
- Do they understand the full implications of this choice?
- How does this moment change the story's trajectory?

Brainstorm below.
