# Beat 19: Resolution — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Resolution shows the immediate aftermath of the
Climactic Confrontation. The central conflict is resolved — for better or worse.
Loose plot threads are tied up, and the consequences of the protagonist's choices
become clear.

**Act**: 3 — The Transformed World

**Questions to consider**:
- What is the outcome of the climactic confrontation?
- What loose ends need to be addressed?
- How do other characters react to the resolution?
- What has been gained and what has been lost?
- How does the resolution reflect the theme?

Brainstorm below.
