# History Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this historical event or period. History in fiction
isn't just backstory — it's the soil from which your present-day conflicts grow.

Think about:
- What happened, and when?
- What caused it? What forces or decisions led to this event?
- Who were the key figures involved?
- What were the immediate consequences?
- What are the long-term ripple effects that still affect your story's present?
- How is this event remembered? Is the "official" version accurate?
- How do different characters or groups view this history?
- What secrets or hidden truths surround it?
