# Government & Politics Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this political system or governing body. Power
structures shape every aspect of your world — who has freedom, who doesn't, and
what people are willing to fight for.

Think about:
- What form does this government take? (monarchy, democracy, theocracy, etc.)
- Who holds power, and how did they get it?
- How are laws made and enforced?
- What are the major political factions or parties?
- What is the relationship between government and ordinary citizens?
- What corruption, injustice, or abuse exists within the system?
- Who is trying to change the system, and how?
- How does this political reality affect your characters?
