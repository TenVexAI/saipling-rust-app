# Geography & Climate Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this geographical or climate element. The physical
world constrains and enables everything — it determines where people live, how
they travel, and what they fight over.

Think about:
- What does the terrain look like? (mountains, plains, coastlines, etc.)
- What is the climate? How does weather affect daily life?
- What natural resources exist here?
- How does geography affect travel, trade, and communication?
- What natural dangers exist? (storms, earthquakes, harsh seasons)
- How has geography shaped the culture and politics of this region?
- What's beautiful about it? What's harsh or unforgiving?
- How does it create story opportunities or obstacles?
