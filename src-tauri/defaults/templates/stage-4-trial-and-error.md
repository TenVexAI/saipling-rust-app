# Stage 4: Trial and Error — Brainstorm
**Character**: {{name}}

**What this stage is**: Trial and Error is the character's learning phase. They're
in the new world, trying things, making mistakes, and slowly building competence.
Early wins build confidence, but their flaw continues to create blind spots.

**Aligns with beats**: Beat 8 (New Reality), Beat 9 (Initial Progress), Beat 10 (Strengthening Allies)

**Questions to consider**:
- What does this character try, and what works or fails?
- What new skills or understanding do they develop?
- How do their relationships with allies deepen during this phase?
- Where does their Defining Flaw cause them to stumble or misjudge?
- What false confidence are they building that will be tested later?

Brainstorm below.
