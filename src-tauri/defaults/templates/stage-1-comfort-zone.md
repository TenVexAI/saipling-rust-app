# Stage 1: Comfort Zone — Brainstorm
**Character**: {{name}}

**What this stage is**: The Comfort Zone shows who the character is BEFORE the
story changes them. Their routines, their coping mechanisms, their worldview —
all of it on display, often without the character realizing how limited it is.

**Aligns with beats**: Beat 1 (Opening Image), Beat 2 (Daily Life)

**Questions to consider**:
- What does a typical day look like for this character?
- What coping mechanisms or habits define their current life?
- What are they avoiding or in denial about?
- How does their Defining Flaw manifest in their daily routine?
- What small details reveal who they really are beneath the surface?

Brainstorm below.
