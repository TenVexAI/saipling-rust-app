# Beat 8: New Reality — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: New Reality opens Act 2. The protagonist is in unfamiliar
territory — new rules, new dangers, new possibilities. This beat establishes the
landscape of the middle story and the protagonist's initial orientation to it.

**Act**: 2 — The Unknown World

**Questions to consider**:
- What does this new world or situation look like?
- What rules or norms are different from what the protagonist knew?
- How does the protagonist react to their new circumstances?
- What opportunities and dangers become apparent?
- Who are the new characters or forces they encounter?

Brainstorm below.
