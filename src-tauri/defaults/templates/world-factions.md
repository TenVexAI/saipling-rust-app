# Faction Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this faction, organization, or group. The most
compelling factions have their own internal logic — they believe they're the
heroes of their own story.

Think about:
- What is this group and what do they want?
- How are they organized? Who leads them?
- What's their origin story? Why do they exist?
- What do they believe in? What values drive them?
- What methods do they use to achieve their goals?
- What are their internal tensions or divisions?
- Who are their allies and enemies?
- How do they recruit or grow their numbers?
- How do your characters relate to this group?
