# Rules & Conventions Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this rule or convention. The best story-world
rules create both possibilities and limitations — they give characters
interesting choices and meaningful constraints.

Think about:
- What is the rule, law, or convention?
- Who established it, and why?
- How is it enforced? What happens when it's broken?
- Who benefits from it? Who suffers under it?
- Are there loopholes, exceptions, or gray areas?
- How do different characters feel about it?
- How does it create conflict or drive plot?
- Is it changing, being challenged, or eroding?
