# Beat 7: End of Known World — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The End of Known World marks the boundary between Act 1
and Act 2. The protagonist's old life is definitively over. The rules they knew
no longer apply. This is the moment of no return — the bridge burns behind them.

**Act**: 1 — The Known World

**Questions to consider**:
- What event or realization seals off the protagonist's old life?
- How does the world shift — literally or metaphorically?
- What final connection to the old world is severed?
- How does the protagonist feel about this transition?
- What new reality awaits them on the other side?

Brainstorm below.
