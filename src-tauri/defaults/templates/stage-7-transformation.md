# Stage 7: Transformation — Brainstorm
**Character**: {{name}}

**What this stage is**: Transformation is where the character fundamentally changes.
Having been broken down by the Supreme Ordeal, they make a choice that the old
version of themselves could never have made. Their Defining Flaw doesn't vanish —
but they finally see it clearly and choose differently.

**Aligns with beats**: Beat 17 (Final Decision), Beat 18 (Climactic Confrontation)

**Questions to consider**:
- What does this character's transformation look like in action?
- What decision do they make that proves they've changed?
- How does their transformation affect the climactic confrontation?
- What do they sacrifice or embrace that their old self couldn't?
- How does this change serve the story's theme?

Brainstorm below.
