# Emotional Promise — Brainstorm

The **Emotional Promise** is what the reader will feel by the end. This is the
contract between author and reader — the emotional experience the story commits
to delivering.

Think about:
- What emotion should the reader feel when they close the book?
- What emotional journey will the reader go through along the way?
- What moments in the story will be the most emotionally powerful?
- How does the emotional promise connect to the theme?
- What genre expectations does your reader bring? How will you fulfill (or subvert) them?
- What personal experiences or emotions are you drawing on?

The emotional promise isn't just about the ending — it's the through-line of
feeling that makes the reader keep turning pages. It's why they picked up this
kind of book in the first place.

Brainstorm your emotional promise below.
