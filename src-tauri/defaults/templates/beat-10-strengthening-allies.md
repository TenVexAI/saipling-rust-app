# Beat 10: Strengthening Allies — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: Strengthening Allies deepens the protagonist's key
relationships. Bonds are tested and solidified. Trust is earned. The protagonist
begins to understand they can't do this alone — and the people around them become
essential to the journey.

**Act**: 2 — The Unknown World

**Questions to consider**:
- Which relationships deepen or solidify at this point?
- What shared experience bonds the protagonist to their allies?
- What vulnerabilities or secrets are revealed?
- How does the protagonist's flaw affect these relationships?
- What role will these allies play in the challenges ahead?

Brainstorm below.
