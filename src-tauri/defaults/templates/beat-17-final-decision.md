# Beat 17: Final Decision — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Final Decision is where the protagonist chooses to
face the conflict one last time — but differently. Having been broken down by
the Darkest Moment, they must find a new way forward. This decision often
requires embracing the very thing their flaw has been preventing.

**Act**: 3 — The Transformed World

**Questions to consider**:
- What does the protagonist decide to do, and why now?
- How is this approach different from everything they've tried before?
- What internal change makes this decision possible?
- What are they willing to sacrifice that they weren't before?
- How does this decision demonstrate growth toward their Need?

Brainstorm below.
