# Story World Fundamentals — Brainstorm

**Story World Fundamentals** — the basic rules and unique elements of the setting.
Not exhaustive world-building — just enough to establish what kind of world this
story takes place in and what makes it distinctive.

Think about:
- What kind of world is this? (contemporary, historical, fantastical, futuristic)
- What are the rules that make this world different from ours?
- What does daily life look like for ordinary people?
- What is the power structure? Who's on top, who's on the bottom?
- What makes this world feel alive and specific?
- How does the world create or amplify the central conflict?
- What aspects of the world will the reader find most compelling?

The story world should feel like a character itself — it shapes everyone in it
and should be inseparable from the story you're telling.

Brainstorm your story world below.
