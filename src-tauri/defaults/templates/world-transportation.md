# Transportation & Travel Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this transportation or travel element. How people
move through your world determines pacing, isolation, connection, and the scale
of conflict.

Think about:
- What methods of travel exist? (foot, animal, vehicle, magical, etc.)
- How long does it take to get between key locations?
- What infrastructure exists? (roads, ports, stations, gates)
- What are the dangers of travel? (bandits, weather, creatures, terrain)
- Who controls the routes? Is travel restricted for anyone?
- How does travel technology affect trade, war, and communication?
- What does travel feel like — comfortable, grueling, thrilling?
- How does travel create story opportunities? (encounters, isolation, time pressure)
