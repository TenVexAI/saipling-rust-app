# Project Brainstorm

This is your space to brain-dump everything about your project — the big ideas,
the vague feelings, the "what if" questions, the scenes you can already see in
your head. Don't worry about structure or consistency here. Just get your ideas
down.

Think about:
- What's the core idea that excites you?
- What kind of story is this? (series, standalone, universe?)
- What genre(s) does it live in?
- What tone or feeling are you going for?
- Any characters, settings, or scenes that are already forming?
- What themes or questions do you want to explore?
- What books, movies, or stories inspire this project?

Write freely below — this document is your starting point, not your final answer.
