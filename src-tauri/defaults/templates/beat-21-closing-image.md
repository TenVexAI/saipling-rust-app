# Beat 21: Closing Image — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Closing Image mirrors the Opening Image — but
transformed. It's the final snapshot that shows how far the protagonist has come.
The reader should feel the distance between where the story began and where it
ends. This is your last impression.

**Act**: 3 — The Transformed World
**Anchor beat**: Yes — this is one of the four structural pillars of your story.

**Questions to consider**:
- What is the final image or moment the reader experiences?
- How does it mirror or contrast with the Opening Image?
- What emotion should the reader feel in this final moment?
- What does this image communicate about the protagonist's transformation?
- Does it leave any intentional ambiguity or resonance?

Brainstorm below.
