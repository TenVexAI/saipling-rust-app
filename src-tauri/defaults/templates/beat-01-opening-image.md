# Beat 1: Opening Image — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The Opening Image is a snapshot of the protagonist's life
BEFORE the story changes everything. It establishes the tone, the world, and the
character's current state — often highlighting the very thing that needs to change.

**Act**: 1 — The Known World

**Questions to consider**:
- What is the first thing the reader sees or experiences?
- What does this moment reveal about the protagonist's current life?
- What tone or mood does this opening establish?
- What visual or sensory details ground the reader in this world?
- How does this opening subtly hint at what needs to change?

Brainstorm below.
