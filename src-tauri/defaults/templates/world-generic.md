# World Entry Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this element of your world. Remember: every
world-building detail should ultimately serve your story — connecting to
characters, conflict, or theme.

Think about:
- What is it and how does it work?
- What are its rules and limitations?
- How does it affect daily life in your world?
- How does it create conflict or story possibilities?
- What's its history — how did it come to exist?
- How do different characters or groups relate to it?

Write freely below.
