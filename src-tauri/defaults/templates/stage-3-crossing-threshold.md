# Stage 3: Crossing the Threshold — Brainstorm
**Character**: {{name}}

**What this stage is**: Crossing the Threshold is when the character leaves their
familiar world behind and commits to the journey. They may be pushed or they may
choose — but either way, they can't go back to who they were.

**Aligns with beats**: Beat 5 (Point of Departure), Beat 6 (First Challenge), Beat 7 (End of Known World)

**Questions to consider**:
- What moment marks this character's point of no return?
- What do they leave behind — relationships, safety, identity?
- How do they handle their first real challenge in unfamiliar territory?
- What new skills, allies, or knowledge do they encounter?
- How does crossing the threshold begin to test their flaw?

Brainstorm below.
