# Beat 20: New Equilibrium — Brainstorm

**What this beat does**: The New Equilibrium shows the protagonist settling into
their changed world. The dust has settled, and we see what "normal" looks like
now. This beat demonstrates the lasting impact of the journey — what's different,
what's healed, and what scars remain.

**Act**: 3 — The Transformed World

**Questions to consider**:
- What does the protagonist's new daily life look like?
- How are they different from who they were at the beginning?
- What relationships have changed, ended, or begun?
- What new role or purpose do they have?
- How does the new equilibrium reflect the theme?

Brainstorm below.
