# Medicine & Science Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this medical or scientific element. How a world
understands health, disease, and the body reveals its level of advancement and
creates life-or-death stakes for characters.

Think about:
- What is the general level of medical/scientific knowledge?
- What can be healed or cured? What remains fatal or mysterious?
- Who practices medicine or science? How are they trained?
- What tools, techniques, or substances are used?
- How accessible is treatment? Who can afford it?
- Are there ethical controversies or forbidden practices?
- How does this affect your characters' vulnerabilities?
- What role does it play in your story's conflicts?
