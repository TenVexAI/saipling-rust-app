# Culture Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this cultural element. Culture is the invisible
architecture of your world — it shapes how characters think, what they value,
and what they take for granted.

Think about:
- What customs, traditions, or rituals define this culture?
- What are the social norms? What's considered polite, rude, or taboo?
- How is society structured? (class, caste, meritocracy, etc.)
- What do people value most? What do they fear?
- How does daily life look for ordinary people?
- How does this culture create conflict or tension in your story?
- How do outsiders perceive this culture?
- What's changing about it, and who resists that change?
