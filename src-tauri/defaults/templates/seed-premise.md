# Central Premise — Brainstorm

The **Central Premise** is a single sentence that captures the entire story. This
is the elevator pitch, the logline, the DNA of the narrative. Everything that
follows must serve this premise.

A strong premise typically contains:
- A character with a specific situation
- A conflict or challenge they face
- The stakes — what happens if they fail
- A hook — what makes this story unique

Example: "A disgraced detective must solve the murder of the woman he once loved,
only to discover the killer is someone he trusted with his life."

Brainstorm your premise ideas below.
