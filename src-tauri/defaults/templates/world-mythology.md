# Mythology & Legends Brainstorm — {{name}}

Dump everything you know about this myth, legend, or prophecy. In-world mythology
adds depth and foreshadowing — what people believe happened in the past often
mirrors what's about to happen in the present.

Think about:
- What is the myth or legend? What story does it tell?
- Who believes it? Who dismisses it?
- Is it true, partially true, or entirely fabricated?
- What purpose does it serve in your world? (explanation, warning, inspiration)
- How does it connect to current events in your story?
- Are there competing versions or interpretations?
- Does it contain prophecy or foreshadowing?
- How do your characters relate to this myth?
