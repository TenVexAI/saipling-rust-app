# Stage 5: Moment of Truth — Brainstorm
**Character**: {{name}}

**What this stage is**: The Moment of Truth is the midpoint crisis for this
character's arc. A revelation, betrayal, or failure forces them to confront
something they've been avoiding. Their old approach stops working, and they
must begin to face the gap between their Want and their Need.

**Aligns with beats**: Beat 11 (Midpoint Shift), Beat 12 (Growing Opposition), Beat 13 (Moment of Doubt)

**Questions to consider**:
- What truth does this character confront at the midpoint?
- How does this truth challenge their worldview or self-image?
- What does the growing opposition cost them personally?
- How does doubt manifest — do they question themselves, their mission, their allies?
- What is the first crack in their Defining Flaw?

Brainstorm below.
