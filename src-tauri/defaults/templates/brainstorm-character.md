- What do they want more than anything? (their conscious desire)
- What do they actually need? (often different from what they want)
- What's their biggest flaw or blind spot?
- What happened in their past that shaped who they are today?
- How do they talk? What makes their voice distinctive?
- What are their key relationships?
