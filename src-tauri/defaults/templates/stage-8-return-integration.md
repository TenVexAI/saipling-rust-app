# Stage 8: Return and Integration — Brainstorm
**Character**: {{name}}

**What this stage is**: Return and Integration shows how the character carries
their transformation back into the world. They're not the same person who left —
and neither is their world. This stage shows how they integrate what they've
learned into a new way of living.

**Aligns with beats**: Beat 19 (Resolution), Beat 20 (New Equilibrium), Beat 21 (Closing Image)

**Questions to consider**:
- How does this character's life look different after the transformation?
- What relationships have changed? Which ones survived the journey?
- How do they relate to their old comfort zone now?
- What wisdom or scars do they carry forward?
- How does their final state reflect the story's theme?

Brainstorm below.
