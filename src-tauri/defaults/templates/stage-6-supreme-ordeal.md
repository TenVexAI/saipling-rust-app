# Stage 6: The Supreme Ordeal — Brainstorm
**Character**: {{name}}

**What this stage is**: The Supreme Ordeal is where this character faces their
greatest challenge — one that strikes at the heart of their Defining Flaw. The
old version of themselves cannot survive this test. They must begin to transform
or be destroyed by their own limitations.

**Aligns with beats**: Beat 14 (Renewed Determination), Beat 15 (Ultimate Challenge), Beat 16 (Darkest Moment)

**Questions to consider**:
- What is the worst thing this character must face or endure?
- How does their Defining Flaw make this ordeal even harder?
- What do they lose that they thought they couldn't live without?
- What moment of renewed determination pushes them forward?
- How does this ordeal crack open the possibility of real change?

Brainstorm below.
