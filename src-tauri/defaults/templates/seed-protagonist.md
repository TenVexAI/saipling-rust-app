# Protagonist Profile — Brainstorm

The **Protagonist Profile** captures the essential traits — not a full character
sheet, just the core. Who is this person at their core? What do they want? What
do they need? What is their defining flaw?

Think about:
- Who is this person when the story begins?
- What do they want more than anything? (their conscious desire)
- What do they actually need? (often the opposite of what they want)
- What is their defining flaw — the internal obstacle that holds them back?
- What past wound or experience created this flaw?
- Why should the reader care about this person?

The protagonist's Want vs. Need is the engine of the character arc. The story
forces them to confront the gap between what they pursue and what they truly need.
